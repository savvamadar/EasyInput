# EasyInput
An input system for unity because I hate the new input system.

Supports multiple local players out of the box.


Features:
- Checking Input Press
- Checking Input Held
- Checking Input Time Held
- Checking Input Released
- Multiple Local Player Support
- Input Controller Swapping via Script


Example Usage:
- Create Object and add EasyInput component
- Look at [KeyboardInputLazy.cs](https://github.com/savvamadar/EasyInput/blob/main/Assets/Demo/LazyInput/KeyboardInputLazy.cs)
- Look at [PlayerMovementLazy.cs](https://github.com/savvamadar/EasyInput/blob/main/Assets/Demo/LazyInput/PlayerMovementLazy.cs)
